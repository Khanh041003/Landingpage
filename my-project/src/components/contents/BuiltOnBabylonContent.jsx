        <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Built on Babylon</h1>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        LayerEdges verification layer is powered by Babylon’s cryptoeconomic security model, enabling zk-protocols to securely operate within Bitcoin’s ecosystem. By leveraging Babylon’s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) model anchored in Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) security, LayerEdge offers scalable, cost-efficient zk-proof verification, ensuring that every protocol built on it is secure, decentralized, and verifiable.
        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2x2 font-bold mb-4">Integration Overview</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Babylon’s shared security provides economic guarantees that zk-proofs settled on LayerEdge maintain the same integrity as Bitcoin itself. The integration ensures that zk-proofs are not only verifiable but also settled with the highest cryptoeconomic security possible. This enables protocols to confidently use LayerEdge for fast, low-cost verification.        </p>
        <h2 className="text-2x2 font-bold mb-4">How Babylon Supports the LayerEdge Verification Layer</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">Babylon brings cryptoeconomic security to LayerEdge by allowing smaller chains to rent Bitcoin’s PoW security. In turn, LayerEdge processes zk-proofs efficiently, ensuring that the computational security of Bitcoin is extended beyond simple transactions to verifiable off-chain execution.</p>
        <h2 className="text-2x2 font-bold mb-4">Key Features:</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">

        - Scalable zk-proof verification: Babylon’s PoS model ensures that all zk-proofs verified on LayerEdge inherit Bitcoin’s trusted security.        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        - Economic Security: With Babylon’s staking capital backing, LayerEdge provides a cost-effective and secure verification layer, eliminating the need for individual protocols to build their own staking mechanisms.        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        - Modular Ecosystem: By combining Babylon’s security guarantees with LayerEdge’s aggregation model, protocols can achieve scalable, secure zk-proof verification while reducing costs.        </p>
