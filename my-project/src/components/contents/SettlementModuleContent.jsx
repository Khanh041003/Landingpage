        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        The LayerEdge Settlement Module provides a trust-minimized mechanism for protocols to settle their computations and states on the Bitcoin blockchain. This system leverages Bitcoinâ€™s unparalleled Proof-of-Work (PoW) security, enabling scalable, cost-effective, and verifiable settlement for protocols, rollups, and decentralized applications.

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">This documentation outlines how LayerEdge performs trust-minimized settlement on Bitcoin using zk-proof aggregation, OP_RETURN, and Cenotaph Rune.        </p>

        <h1 className="text-2x2 font-bold mb-4">1. Aggregation of zk-Proofs</h1>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Protocols (e.g., Rollups, AI Computation, DePIN, and DA solutions) submit Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to the LayerEdge. These proofs represent validated computations or state transitions from their respective layers.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        LayerEdge aggregates multiple ZKPs into a single, compact proof using proof recursion. This aggregation significantly reduces the size of the proof and minimizes on-chain storage requirements, reducing settlement costs by up to 99%.
