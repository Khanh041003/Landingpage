          LayerEdge is the first decentralized network that enhances the capabilities of Bitcoin Blockchain with ZK & BitVM, enabling every layer to be secured on Bitcoin.

            Often efficient settlement on Bitcoin is linked with dependency on OP_Cat being enabled on Bitcoin L1.

          How much efficient we can make L1 settlement & proof verification with LayerEdge?
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          LayerEdge achieves up to 95% reduction in L1 settlement costs through shared transactions, and up to 99% reduction in proof verification costs through aggregation. As more protocols join the network, costs decrease further â€” enabling what was previously economically unfeasible. A single verification can drop an average cost from $900+ to less than $20 per protocol on Bitcoin, in a network of 50+ protocols.
